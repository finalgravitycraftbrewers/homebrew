<a id="about-us" class="anchor" href="#about-us" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>About Us</h3>

<p>Final Gravity is an Atlanta, GA based club that promotes homebrewing and appreciation of beer for beginners and experts alike. We meet every first Wednesday of the month at 7:30 PM to discuss the many aspects of home brewing. Through technical discussions, group brewing, and group experiments, we strive to share knowledge and obtain the skills to become better brewers.  The club was started by Bob Sandage in 2005 and has been active in the Little 5 Points area ever since.</p>
<p>Our primary communication to the club is conducted via <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/final-gravity">Google Groups: Final-Gravity</a>. We also have a Facebook group forum for discussion at <a href="https://facebook.com/groups/140009839495411?tsid=0.14403708698228002&source=typeahead">Final Gravity Craftbrewers of Atlanta.</p>

<p>Meetings are generally held the first Wednesday  of each month at 7:30pm. We meet at different locations around the Little 5 Points area based on availability and send a reminder via the Google Group to notify everyone of the location. Our standing agenda  includes (1) discussion of past and upcoming events, (2) presentation and evaluation of homebrews and  BJCP-style judging feedback, and (3) technical presentations on topics that are intended to further the knowledge and brewing proficiency of club members.</p>
